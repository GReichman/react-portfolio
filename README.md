## Description
   This project was made to update my portfolio to a React site

## Usage
  When visiting the site, you will start on my personal page. It contains a short description of myself, my email, my location, and my phone number. Using the navbar at the top of the page, you can visit my portfolio page to view projects i have displayed, or my Links page. The portfolio contains examples of projects I have taken part in. Each example contains a screenshot of the application as well as links to the deployed site and repository. My Links page contains links to my resume and profiles on github/linkedin. Simply click on what you would like to view to have the page load in a new tab.
